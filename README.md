# Football-Tracking
âš½ Player Re-Identification in a Single Feed (YOLOv5 + Deep SORT)
This project detects and tracks football players throughout a video using a custom YOLOv5 model and Deep SORT. Each player is assigned a unique ID in the first few seconds, which persists even if the player temporarily leaves and re-enters the frame (e.g., near goal events).
